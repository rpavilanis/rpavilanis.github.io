          Hello! My name is Rachel Pavilanis. I am an aspiring software developer, attending the Seattle-based <a href="http://www.adadevelopersacademy.org">Ada Developer's Academy</a> as a member of Cohort 6. Ada Developer's Academy is a year-long software development training program, with six months of intensive in-class work followed by a five month internship at a sponsoring Seattle-based company. In this program, I am learning Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I am also gaining practical experience working on project teams and a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals. I will graduate in July of 2017, and will then be working as a full-stack software developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to this new venture, I worked in the field of school psychology for five years, providing school-based school psychology support while also adding district responsibilities like Positive Behavior Interventions and Support Coach and Preschool Transition Coordinator. I am originally from Michigan, but I have lived in the Eugene, Oregon area for approximately eight years, with my partner and two small dogs.  In my spare time, I love to read fantasy novels, explore the beautiful Pacific Northwest, and <a href = "http://www.soundcloud.com/rachel-pavilanis">write/record folk-pop songs</a>.

        <p> I just finished my third week at Ada Developer’s Academy.   As I settle into my routine at Ada, I keep having the same thought – “So this is what it feels like to love what you do…”.  This thought brings about scary, overwhelming, intoxicating, and unfamiliar feelings.  I always thought I would live...  <a href=content/blog.html#anchor1> read more </a> </p>

        <p> I have thought a lot about why I want to be a software developer over the past six months, partially because the application and interview process at Ada necessitated that I do this, but also because I wanted to be very thoughtful about taking this step toward a new career.

        <p> Ada Developer’s Academy emailed me to let me know I have been accepted into their sixth cohort!!!  When I found out, I was on my lunch break at a pizza place in Springfield.  I had been obsessively checking my email for almost a week, so my phone wasn’t far from me when I heard the soft ding that signaled I received an email... <a href=content/blog.html#anchor3> read more </a> </p>
